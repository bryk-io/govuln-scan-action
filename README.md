Go provides tooling to analyze your codebase and surface known vulnerabilities. This
tooling is backed by the Go vulnerability database, which is curated by the Go security
team. Goâ€™s tooling reduces noise in your results by only surfacing vulnerabilities in
functions that your code is actually calling.

> __Important__: The go version used to build `govulncheck` must match the version
> used in your project. Use the input `go-version` to specify the version to be used.
> If not provided the latest version available will be used by default.
>
> For more information about this requirement please refer to this issue
> <https://github.com/golang/go/issues/55045>.

jobs:
  # govulncheck scan
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      # Checkout code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Vulnerabilities scan
      - name: Go vulnerabilities scan
